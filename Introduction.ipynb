        "Google training video summaries it nicely as \"*Supervised ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data*\". Simple examples: Predicting price of a house, classifying an incoming mail as spam / not spam\n",
        "### Label\n",
        "Label is the thing we predict, it is the outcome or output. Usually denoted by *y*\n",
        "### Features\n",
        "Features are the inputs to the machine learning system. Usually denoted by *x* . Most ML systems take multiple inputs called feature sets and are typically denoted as \n",

        "Model is the box that explains the relationship between features and label. A model is then used on never-before-seen data of features to predict the label\n",
