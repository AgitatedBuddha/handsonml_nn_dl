    "Given an input image of cat, the ability to determin if its a cat (1) or not cat(0) is an example of binary classification. Logistic regression is one of the algorithms for binary classification\n",

    "Any image is composed of Red(R), Blue(B), Green(G) and the intensity of these values can be defined as vectors. Refer example below\n",

    "A typical 64(height)x64(width) image, then has 3x64x64 values. These values can be represented as matrices. This is the input given to the alogrithm and is called as feature vector, denoted by X. Dimension of input feature vector X denoted by $N_x$, in this example $N_x$ = 64 * 64 * 3 = 12288. The output is denoted by Y and for binary classification its usually 0 or 1.  \n",
